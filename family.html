<h2 text align="center">Zack's Family History</h2><br />
<p>Wow. You actually want to know about my family's history? I'll try keeping this as interesting as possible. My family is your typical all-American family. We are die-hard New York Giants fans as well as other New York-based sports teams. Just don't mention the Yankees in front any Eidman. Most of us have taken on hobby of fresh-water fishing, a sport which my grandfather pretty much forced us all to like. When it comes to fishing, he can do things that few experienced fishermen can explain. See the YouTube video below. </p><br /><br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHedOY0RXnc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>I met my wife while I was attending Rutgers University back in 2004 and we got married in 2007. Since then, we've been blessed with the coolest kid in the tri-state area (at the very least). He takes after his daddy and loves playing and watching all types of sports, specifically hockey and football. My gorgeous wife Dina went into labor during the 2011 NFC Championship game and I told her that we aren't going to the hospital until the game was over. Thank God, Cooper-Pierre took his time and allowed me to watch my Giants win an epic game in overtime against the 49ers. And yes, we named him after Giants defensive-end Jason Pierre-Paul. Two and a half years later, Cooper-Pierre spends his Sundays watching the Giants and weeknights staying up past his bedtime to cheer on the Islanders. I have to say, when it comes to the kid-department, I am blessed.<br /><br />

    <p>And of course who can forget about my amazing wife, Dina. Like Cooper, since meeting me, she has taken a liking to all of my sports-obsession and she's a great fisherwoman taboot!</p>

    <p>And how can this page be complete without mentioning my best friend since college, Mr. Steve "Tuco" McQueen. I found him on my pourch one day as I returned home from class. He was no more than a month old. He's been with me ever since. Steve is also an avid sports fan.</p>
